       "'That phrase hints at a grim reality: witch burnings were less about individual insecurity and more about fear, power, and social control carried out through violence.\\n\\nKey points:\\n- Why they burned witches: Many communities believed witches truly harmed others and that demonology was real. Religious and political authorities often framed witchcraft as a dire threat to unity and salvation, justifying harsh measures.\\n- The social dynamics: Most accused were women, the elderly, the poor, or people with disputed property or unconventional behavior. Trials often reflected local disputes, envy, or fear of social change as much as any “true” belief in witchcraft.\\n- How burning fit the system: Public executions served as a stark demonstration of power, a deterrent, and a ritual cleansing in the eyes of authorities. The method varied by region, but burning was used in some places for its symbolic finality and perceived effectiveness in “purging” evil.\\n- The bigger picture: The witch hunts were supported by legal frameworks, torture to extract confessions, and a climate of paranoia. They declined as rationalist thinking and legal reforms took hold in the 17th–18th centuries.\\n- Modern view: Today, witch burnings are condemned as human rights abuses and as history’s warning about how fear and power can escalate into mass violence.\\n\\nIf you want, tell me a particular region or time period (e.g., Germany 16th–17th century, Scotland, Salem in colonial America), and I can give a more focused explanation.'"
